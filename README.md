# Contrastive learning for change detection with SAR data (radar)

Project for the course "Remote sensing data: from sensor to large-scale geospatial data exploitation " :
The objective of this project is to build a representation of SAR data separating the changed and unchanged
areas as presented in [1]. For this purpose, we propose to perform the learning of the neural network in a
contrastive way by using 1) the imaginary and real parts of a SAR image for similar samples [2] and 2)
different locations in the image for the changed samples. The training will be done on multi-temporal stack
of Stripmap TerraSAR-X data.
